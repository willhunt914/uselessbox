# uselessbox


Goal: The goal is to create a box that when a switch is pressed it will turn itself off. 
Problems: sometimes I had problems with getting motivated. I also had some problems focusing on the project. Sometimes it was hard to work as a team as well. 

The box should be 103.2 wide by 150. It will be made of 3.2 inch acrilic with the brackets and arm will be 3d printed 

Materials:
acrylic walls,
#4-40 socket head screws and nuts,
Arduino,
Batteries ,
wires ,
3d printer filiment,
switch,
led ,
container to hold bateries. 
We estimate this will cost around 15 to 20 dollars.

This is the box that will be made in onshape

this is the arm that is going to be atatched to the box it will turn off the switch


[code](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/whunt29a/40efa559-dfd3-461b-b00e-44b984502a94) This is the code that will control the arduino to move the arm

Schedule 
March 31 be finished with the plan 
April 20th  we should start building the project.
May 5th done building 
May 7 be finished with the project 

This is what we planned but onshape took longer than we thought.
